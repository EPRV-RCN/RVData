0,PRIMARY,PrimaryHDU,False,True,EPRV Standard FITS HEADER (no data),Carried forward from L2 FITS file
1,INSTRUMENT_HEADER,ImageHDU,False,True,Inherited instrument header (no data),Carried forward from L2 FITS file
2,RECEIPT,BinTableHDU,False,True,Table of operations that have been performed on this file,
3,DRP_CONFIG,BinTableHDU,False,True,Pipeline details (settings etc) to go from native data to L2
4,CORR_TRACE1_FLUX,ImageHDU,True,True,Flux in trace 1,This flux has been blaze corrected
5,CORR_TRACE1_WAVE,ImageHDU,True,True,Wavelength solution for trace 1,This wavelength solution has been both drift and barycentric corrected
6,CORR_TRACE1_VAR,ImageHDU,True,True,Variance for trace 1,This variance is based on the blaze corrected flux (CORR_TRACE1_FLUX)
7,BJD_TDB,ImageHDU,False,True,photon weighted midpoint,Format should convey how this is applied to the wavelength solution -- can be a single value in which case 1 correction for whole array; can be an array of Norders in which case there's a different correction for each order; or can be array of Nord x Mpix in which case there's a different correction for each pixel
8,CUSTOMCORR1_TRACE1_FLUX,ImageHDU,True,False,Additionally corrected flux in trace 1,This could include additional corrections such as telluric or sky corrections -- should have same format as CORR_TRACE1_FLUX above
9,CUSTOMCORR1_TRACE1_WAVE,ImageHDU,True,False,Additionally corrected wavelength solution for trace 1,Wavelength solution -- should have same format as CORR_TRACE1_WAVE above
10,CUSTOMCORR1_TRACE1_VAR,ImageHDU,True,False,Additionally corrected variance for the flux in trace 1,Variance of the CUSTOMCORR1_TRACE1_FLUX flux array -- should have same format as CORR_TRACE1_VAR above
