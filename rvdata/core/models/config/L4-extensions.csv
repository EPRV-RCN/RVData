2,RECEIPT,BinTableHDU,FALSE,TRUE,Table of operations that have been performed on this file,
3,DRP_CONFIG,BinTableHDU,FALSE,TRUE,Pipeline details (settings etc) to go from native data to L2,
4,RV1...N,BinTableHDU,TRUE,TRUE,Derived Radial Velocity Measurement,"Required Columns: BJD_TDB [64bit], wave_start [64bit], wave_end [64bit], pixel_start, pixel_end, RV_Trace1-N, RV_error, BC_vel, order index, echelle order Optional columns [teams can add more if they like]: 
pixel_start, pixel_end, order_index, echelle_order, weight, residual_drift note: weight is a roll up of multiple weighting factors (throughput, color correction, etc) applied to the RV in the same row of this table and should be defined by the instrument team in the their read the docs page"
