# EPRV_DataStandard
Development of a community endorsed, standardized EPRV data format at the 1D extracted spectra level, and a set of translator tools

## Objective

1) Establish a community recommendation for standardized RV data and telemetry formats based upon input from participating (E)PRV instrument teams and partners from the observatories and data archives that will host the data for each instrument

2) Develop prototype ‘translator’ tools that will re-write data from the native spectrograph outputs into this community standard format, and act as a template for other instruments to do the same.

Note: These continue to be in development for the time being, but the links below capture the current data format as recommended by this group
